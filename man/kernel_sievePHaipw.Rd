}
\arguments{
\item{eventTime}{a numeric vector specifying the observed right-censored
event time.}

\item{eventInd}{a numeric vector indicating the event of interest (1 if
event, 0 if right-censored).}

\item{mark}{a numeric vector specifying a univariate continuous mark subject
to missingness at random. Missing mark values should be set to \code{NA}.
For subjects with \code{eventInd = 0}, the value in \code{mark} should also
be set to \code{NA}.}

\item{tx}{a numeric vector indicating the treatment group (1 if treatment, 0
if placebo).}

\item{aux}{a numeric vector specifying a binary or a continuous auxiliary
covariate which may be potentially useful for predicting missingness, i.e,
the probability of missing, and for informing about the distribution of
missing marks. The mark missingness model only requires that the auxiliary
covariates be observed in subjects who experienced the event of interest.
For subjects with \code{eventInd = 0}, the value in \code{aux} may be set
to \code{NA}. If no auxiliary covariate is used, set \code{aux} to the
default of \code{NULL}.}

\item{auxType}{a character string describing the data type of \code{aux} if
\code{aux} is used. Data types allowed include "binary" and "continuous".
If \code{aux} is not used, \code{auxType} should be set to the default of
\code{NULL}.}

\item{zcov}{a data frame with one row per subject specifying possibly
time-dependent covariate(s) (not including \code{tx}). If no covariate is
used, \code{zcov} should be set to the default of \code{NULL}.}

\item{strata}{a numeric vector specifying baseline strata (\code{NULL} by
default). If specified, a separate mark-specific baseline hazard is assumed
for each stratum. It also allows the models of the probability of
complete-case and of the mark distribution to differ across strata.}

\item{formulaPH}{a one-sided formula object (on the right side of the
\code{~} operator) specifying the linear predictor in the proportional
hazards model. Available variables to be used in the formula include
\code{tx} and variable(s) in \code{zcov}. By default, \code{formulaPH} is
specified as \code{~ tx}.}

\item{formulaMiss}{a one-sided formula object (on the right side of the
\code{~} operator) specifying the linear predictor in the logistic
regression model used for predicting the probability of observing the mark.
\code{formulaMiss} must be provided for the \code{AIPW} method. Available
variables to be used in the formula include \code{eventTime}, \code{tx},
\code{aux}, and variable(s) in \code{zcov}.}

\item{formulaAux}{a one-sided formula object (on the right side of the
\code{~} operator) specifying the variables used for estimating the
conditional distribution of \code{aux}. If \code{aux} is binary, the
formula specifies the linear predictor in a logistic regression and if
\code{aux} is continuous, the formula provides a symbolic description of
variables used in kernel conditional density estimation. \code{formulaAux}
is optional for the \code{AIPW} estimation procedure. Available variables
to be used in the formula include \code{eventTime}, \code{tx}, \code{mark},
and variable(s) in \code{zcov}.}

\item{tau}{a numeric value specifying the duration of study follow-up period.
Failures beyond \code{tau} are treated right-censored. There needs to be at
least \eqn{10\%} of subjects (as a rule of thumb) remaining uncensored by
\code{tau} for the estimation to be stable. By default, \code{tau} is set
as the maximum of \code{eventTime}.}

\item{tband}{a numeric value between 0 and \code{tau} specifying the
bandwidth of the kernel smoothing function over time. By default,
\code{tband} is set as (\code{tau}-min(\code{eventTime}))/5.}

\item{hband}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the bandwidth of the
kernel smoothing function over mark. By default, \code{hband} is set as
\eqn{4\sigma n^{-1/3}} where \eqn{\sigma} is the estimated standard
deviation of the observed marks for uncensored failure times and \eqn{n} is
the number of subjects in the dataset. Larger bandwidths are recommended
for higher percentages of missing marks.}

\item{nvgrid}{an integer value (100 by default) specifying the number of
equally spaced mark values between the minimum and maximum of the observed
mark for which the treatment effects are evaluated.}

\item{a}{a numeric value between the minimum and maximum of observed mark
values specifying the lower bound of the range for testing the null
hypotheses \eqn{H_{10}: HR(v) = 1} and \eqn{H_{20}: HR(v)} does not depend
on \eqn{v}, for \eqn{v \in [a, b]}; By default, \code{a} is set as
\code{(max(mark) - min(mark))/nvgrid + min(mark)}.}

\item{b}{a numeric value between the minimum and maximum of observed mark
specifying the upper bound of the range for testing the null hypotheses
\eqn{H_{10}: HR(v) = 1} and \eqn{H_{20}: HR(v)} does not depend on \eqn{v},
for \eqn{v \in [a, b]}; By default, \code{b} is set as \eqn{max(mark)}.}

\item{ntgrid}{an integer value (\code{NULL} by default) specifying the number
of equally spaced time points for which the mark-specific baseline hazard
functions are evaluated. If \code{NULL}, baseline hazard functions are not
evaluated.}

\item{nboot}{number of bootstrap iterations (500 by default) for simulating
the distributions of test statistics. If \code{NULL}, the hypotheses tests
are not performed.}

\item{seed}{an integer specifying the random number generation seed for
reproducing the test statistics and p-values. By default, a specific seed
is not set.}

\item{maxit}{Maximum number of iterations to attempt for convergence in
estimation. The default is 6.}

\item \code{cBproc2}: a data frame containing equally-spaced mark values in

\description{
\code{kernel_sievePH} implements estimation methods of Sun and Gilbert (2012)
and hypothesis testing methods of Gilbert and Sun (2015) for a mark-specific
proportional hazards model accommodating that some failures have a missing
mark. The methods allow separate baseline mark-specific hazard functions for
different baseline subgroups. Missing marks are handled via augmented IPW
(AIPW) approach.
}
\details{
\code{kernel_sievePH} analyzes data from a randomized
  placebo-controlled trial that evaluates treatment efficacy for a
  time-to-event endpoint with a continuous mark. The parameter of interest is
  the ratio of the conditional mark-specific hazard functions
  (treatment/placebo), which is based on a stratified mark-specific
  proportional hazards model. This model assumes no parametric form for the
  baseline hazard function nor the treatment effect across different mark
  values. For data with missing marks, the estimation procedure leverages
  auxiliary predictors of whether the mark is observed and augments the IPW
  estimator with auxiliary predictors of the missing mark value.
