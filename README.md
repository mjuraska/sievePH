## sievePH: Sieve Analysis Methods for Mark-Specific Proportional Hazards Models
`sievePH` is an R package implementing estimation and testing procedures described in:
* Juraska M and Gilbert PB (2013). Mark-specific hazard ratio model with multivariate continuous marks: An application to vaccine efficacy. *Biometrics* 69, 328-337. PMCID: PMC3940058.
* Juraska M and Gilbert PB (2016). Mark-specific hazard ratio model with missing multivariate marks. *Lifetime Data Analysis* 22(4): 606-25. PMCID: PMC4848257.

<!--Following the initial release, the main future goals will be
* to implement an extension allowing more flexible parametric weight functions in the mark density ratio model, and
* to implement alternative published methods based on proportional hazards models using nonparametric kernel smoothing for estimation of the mark distribution.-->
