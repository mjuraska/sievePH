* Juraska M and Gilbert PB (2016). Mark-specific hazard ratio model with missing multivariate marks. *Lifetime Data Analysis* 22(4): 606-25.

and nonparametric estimation and testing procedures described in

* Sun Y and Gilbert PB (2012). Estimation of stratified mark-specific proportional hazards models with missing marks. *Scandinavian Journal of Statistics*, 39(1):34-52.
* Gilbert PB and Sun Y (2015). Inferences on relative failure rates in stratified mark-specific proportional hazards models with missing marks, with application to human immunodeficiency virus vaccine efficacy trials.

<!--Following the initial release, the main future goals will be
* to implement an extension allowing more flexible parametric weight functions in the mark density ratio model, and
* to implement alternative published methods based on proportional hazards models using nonparametric kernel smoothing for estimation of the mark distribution.-->
